# Sample code for the rest of myself and rest of the team. and a playground for test out new ideas
> I steal code, refactor, understand, and then explain to my team mates, for the sake of efficiency. I dub this the "spearhead" Strategy. Others spearheaded the Gazebo & ROS tasks  

## Sample code for 
* DDPG
  - Continous LunarLander, failed to "solve" despite 0 changes by myself
* Actor Critic
  - Failed to "Solve". Just sample code to skim
* (Dueling) Deep Q learning - CNN
  - SpaceInvaders
  - Hard coded extension to use pre trained MobileNet, not very good performance 
* (Dueling) Deep Q learning 
  - Cartpole and LunarLander
