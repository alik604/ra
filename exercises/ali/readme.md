# Sample code for myself and rest of the team and a playground for test out new ideas
> I steal code, refactor, understand, and then explain to my team mates, for the sake of efficiency. I dub this the "spearhead" Strategy. Others spearheaded the Gazebo & ROS tasks  

## Sample code for 
* World Models
  * Model based RL. Code is complex and CPU expensive. Takes long to run.  
* TD-DDPG
  - Solved Continous Lunar Lander
* DDPG
  - Continous Lunar Lander, failed to "solve" despite 0 changes by myself
* Actor Critic
  - Failed to "Solve". 
* (Dueling) Deep Q learning - CNN
  - Solved Space Invaders
  - Hard coded extension to use pre trained *MobileNet*
* (Dueling) Deep Q learning 
  - Solved Cartpole 
  - Solved Lunar Lander 

## Resources 
* [Policy Grads, several algos, well documented, but not D4PG](https://github.com/MrSyee/pg-is-all-you-need)

 * [Cart pole, Q-learning like algo, well documented](https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning/blob/master/lab3/solutions/RL_Solution.ipynb)
