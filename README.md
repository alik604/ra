# ABOUT THIS BRANCH

This was Emma's branch for MCTS, which was to be applied to Ali's HINN (Human Intent Neural Network)  

The monte carlo branch's outdated env was used by Ali who needed a 100% stable environment, as a change to main would not run on his computer. This branch is now hard-merged into `World Models` branch
