# ABOUT THIS BRANCH

> Some files (TD-DDPG) were deleted post merge by accident. This branch is deprecated and scheduled for detection. Currently it is a playground.    

This is (Khizr) Ali's branch. used for **ALL** model-less RL stuff. a bit of the World Models's debugging, however most of it was does in the wolrd models branch & the monte carlo branch.

The monte carlo branch is outdated. `main` was merges into it (update ROS stuff) and a breaking change occurred. so I got world_models code working on a past branch, and forced those changed onto the `world models` branch. That world_models code was in part written here. 


This is (Khizr) Ali's only branch. I would code on Emma's branches as needed (`world models` and `monte carlo`) 

What's done here? 
TD-DDPG and debugging code
